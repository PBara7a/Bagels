# Bagels

Deductive logic game.

How to Play:

The game will generate a random number with no repeated digits. 
Usually its played with a three digit number, but you can adjust the number of digits before playing. 
Then you attempt to guess the number, and the clues after each attempt are:

If the guess has no digits correct, you will get: “Bagel.”
For each digit that is correct but in the wrong place, you will get: “Pico.”
For each digit that is correct and in the correct place, you will get: “Fermi.”

To win you must guess the number before you reach the maximun number of attempts.
You can choose how many attempts you want before playing.

Good luck, and have fun!
